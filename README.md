### **1. 📈 Optimal Entry Window**

Evaluates the best entry window based on volume, price trend, and volatility:

```javascript
function optimalEntry(currentVol, hourlyTrend, volatility) {
  if (volatility < 25 && hourlyTrend < 0) return "Entry Recommended";
  if (volatility < 40) return "Wait for confirmation";
  return "Avoid Entry";
}
```
> currentVol: Current trading volume
> hourlyTrend: Price change in the last hour (%)
> volatility: Standard deviation of the price

2. ⏳ Timing Grade (A–F)
Gives a letter grade reflecting the health of the current market condition:
```javascript
function timingGrade(trendScore, entrySignal) {
  if (trendScore > 80 && entrySignal === "Entry Recommended") return "A";
  if (trendScore > 60) return "B";
  if (trendScore > 40) return "C";
  if (trendScore > 20) return "D";
  return "F";
}
```
> trendScore: A score based on market trends
> entrySignal: Signal indicating the entry recommendation

3. 🔄 Cycle Momentum %
Shows how close the token is to its cycle peak:

```javascript
function cycleMomentum(minutesSincePeak) {
  return Math.max(0, 100 - (minutesSincePeak * 2));
}
```
> minutesSincePeak: Time (in minutes) since the token last peaked

4. 📊 Session Heat Index
Simulates the "heat" of the current trading session:

```javascript
function sessionHeatIndex(vol, wallets, txCount) {
  return Math.min(Math.floor((vol * 0.0005) + wallets * 0.5 + txCount * 0.2), 100);
}
```
> vol: Trading volume in the session
> wallets: Number of active wallets
> txCount: Number of transactions in the session

5. 🕰️ Entry-Exit Clock
A visual indicator of how far you are from the peak moment:

```javascript
function entryExitClock(deltaMinutes) {
  if (deltaMinutes <= 5) return "NOW";
  if (deltaMinutes <= 15) return "Approaching";
  if (deltaMinutes <= 30) return "Watch Zone";
  return "Wait";
}
```
> deltaMinutes: Time difference from the peak moment (in minutes)
